# Automatic Bag Valve Ventilator #

(Versión en Español más abajo)

This is the main repository for the Automatic Bag Valve Ventilator.

This is an open-source emergency oscillating ventilator currently being developed by a local team in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

We've processed a lot of information from other valuable projects such as the Ambovent (Israel).

The goal of the project is to be able to develop a cheap, easy to manufacture and build, emergency ventilator.

### This is -for the moment- NOT aimed to be used as a standard, medical grade ventilator. It is aimed as a last resort ventilator, when the alternative is death. ###

We have the design completed and have sent all parts to production.

We're also working on the software for the Arduino controller.

We will soon update the schematics, material list and other details.
